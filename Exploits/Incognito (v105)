This utilises a mistake introduced in Chrome OS 105, allowing users to bypass filters and browse in Incognito mode by opening a window from the obscure captive portal window.
History is not recorded in Incognito mode. It is recommended to disconnect from the DNS for better browsing when the Incognito window is open.

This exploit has been patched for some time but it works on older versions.

IP addresses:
150.136.163.0
158.101.114.159
129.213.58.41

52.207.185.90 
158.111.114.159

Steps:
1. Go to settings.
2. Click on the wifi name you are using and click it again.
3. Go to the 'Network' section and click it.
4. Scroll down until you find the 'Name servers' section.
5. Change the option to 'Custom Name Servers'.
6. Paste in 52.207.185.90 for the boxes.
7. There should be a notification saying 'Open a new tab'. Click that and now you should be in a small window.
8. As the window says, click the Browse Incognito button.
9. Go back to the network settings and change the custom name servers back to automatic name servers.

Sign-in screen version (Webview):
1. On the sign-in screen, go to your wifi settings and click on the wifi you're using right now.
2. Scroll down until you see Network. Once you see the option click it.
3. Scroll down until you find "Custom name servers". Once you find the option, click it.
4. Paste in the IP Server (52.207.185.90).
5. On the Network settings, click the sign in and now you should be in a small window with some instructions with 2 buttons. 
Click the blue link and now you have an unblocked webview of Google.

Notes:
If you close out of the Incognito Tab, you have to do all the steps again.
If the popup doesn't show, try again.
