How to clear your history... (v106+)

Method 1:
1. Sign out of your account.
2. Remove that account.
3. Sign in to add your account back.
4. There, you're done!
Remember this though, you will lose all your files saved to your Chromebook. Make sure to back them up into your Google Drive.

Method 2: This is the same but you also remove synced data
IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS WILL WIPE ALL SYNCED DATA, NOT JUST HISTORY
SYNCED DATA INCLUDES APPS, NON-MANAGED EXTENSIONS, BOOKMARKS, AND MORE.

1. Make sure you're synced to Google Chrome or else it won't work, as you need to be able to access chrome.google.com/sync.
2. Go to https://chrome.google.com/sync
3. Press "clear data" at the bottom
4. Sign out of your account and remove the account from the device
5. Sign back in and history should be gone
