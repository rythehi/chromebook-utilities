javascript:(function(){if (location.hostname == 'docs.google.com') {document.body.innerHTML = document.body.innerHTML.replace('Locked mode is on', 'Are you ready to turn off extensions?%27);%20document.body.innerHTML%20=%20document.body.innerHTML.replace(%22You%20have%20already%20opened%20and%20closed%20this%20quiz.%20Opening%20this%20quiz%20again%20will%20notify%20the%20form%20owner%20by%20email.%22,%20%22This%20will%20reload%20all%20tabs%20in%20your%20browser%22);%20var%20button%20=%20document.getElementById(%27mG61Hd%27);%20button.innerHTML%20=%20button.innerHTML.replace(%22Start%20Quiz%22,%20%22Disable%20Extensions%22);%20button.addEventListener(%27click%27,%20function(event){window.close();})}%20else%20{window.open(%22https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/d/e/1FAIpQLSf5EYwrSUjmQhBOasMpORZy80eBCYb7qCpEwWNoRPUGyObGMA/startquiz%22);}})()

If you can't access the form you'll need to make one yourself. Here's how to do so:
1. Go to https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/?tgif=c
2. Make a new blank form.
3. Click Settings.
4. Click Make this a quiz.
5. Turn locked mode on.
6. Click preview.
7. Profit.
