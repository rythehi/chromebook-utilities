This webview was found by me!

Steps:
1. Go to this link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.viewsonic.droid&hl=en&gl=US
2. Download it. If you can't then you cannot use this exploit. 
3. Open the app.
4. Click "Let's sign up!" on the sign up window. It will open a MyViewBoard sign up page.
5. Open a new tab in the app. It will open a different MyViewBoard page but you can ignore this.
--> Extra note: On this MyViewBoard page, you can click the google icon to log in to your personal google account.
6. Put any link in the search box (for example, https://discord.com - also you will need the https://) and click enter. 
If there isn't adjust the tab window with the squares in the bottom right. Or alternatively, click the icon between the "-" and the "X".
--> You can also put a term and it will search the term with google too! For example, put discord and it will search discord.
7. Profit.

Notes:
-- If you closed the sign up window, then click the icon in the bottom right.

Issues:
It's a bit slow at loading pages and crashes sometimes.
The CTRL key doesn't work :(
