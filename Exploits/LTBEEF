This is LTBEEF, an exploit to unblock ANY website! Note that this has been patched for a long time.

1. Copy the Javascript code from either of the two bookmarklets below.
2. Make a new bookmark on your Chromebook.
3. Put the Javascript code in the URL section of the bookmark.
4. Visit https://chrome.google.com/webstorex. If it doesn't work, replace the x with anything else.
5. Click on the bookmark you made.
6. Switch off the extensions you don't want to have anymore with the GUI.
7. You're done! The extension should now be disabled.
