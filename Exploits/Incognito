This is an exploit that lets you use incognito. It does TWO things!
Nothing you search will be in your history AND extensions can't block stuff too!

Steps:
1. Go to settings.
2. Click on the wifi name you are using and click it again.
3. Go to the 'Network' section and click it.
4. Scroll down until you find the 'Name servers' section.
5. Change the option to 'Custom Name Servers'.
6. Paste in 52.207.185.90 for the boxes.
7. There should be a notification saying 'Open a new tab'. Click that and now you should be in a small window.
8. As the window says, click the Browse Incognito button.
9. Go back to the network settings and change the custom name servers back to automatic name servers.

Notes:
If you close out of the Incognito Tab you have to do all the steps again.
If the popup doesn't show try again.
This exploit has been patched for some time, but it works on older versions.
