"Help! Discord is blocked on my school chromebook and I can't access the proxies!"
I'm sure you know at least one! You probably won't need more that one proxy, anyways.

"But what if it gets banned?"
I guess if it get banned, you would want some backups... but you don't need 1000 proxies, do you? 

"Ok, but unfortunately I don't have any unblocked proxies anymore!"
If you actually need some, can't you use another device to access Discord? 

"But I'm only 9 and my parents blocked Discord!"
If you desperately need one, search "school chromebook proxy 2023" up on YouTube and find some there.

"But the word proxy is blocked!"
If the word proxy is blocked, put it in Russian. Worked for me.

"But my school has detections for all languages"
Fine, I'll give you one here on Github.

"But I don't have a Github account!"
Make an account then.

"But it's blocked!"
Make it on your phone, you must be viewing it there.

"But I'm only 7 and my parents banned me from signing up for Github."
Ask your friend.

"But I have no friends!"
Just ask people until someone agrees.

"But no one wants to"
Follow the tutorials to make proxies. Make a temporary Github account and delete it after so your parents don't find out.

"But I'm a noob"
I DON'T CARE!!!
