CURRENT VERSION:
https://github.com/005Konz/Blooket-Cheats
https://gitlab.com/blooket/blooket-cheats

Original:
https://minesraft2.github.io/Blooket-Cheats/
https://github.com/Minesraft2/Blooket-gui

Unfortunately, minesraft2 was ceased and desisted by Blooket (and got terminated from Github). 05konz would back it up with permission from minesraft2 and then proceed to start making updates for the project.

Unfortunately, 05konz got terminated from Github, likely for the same reason as minesraft2.

This was used as a backup (NOT UPDATED!):
https://github.com/Shploop/Blooket-Cheats

However, 05konz came back and is now updating the Blooket cheats on a new GitHub as well as GitLab.

How to use:
