VIDEOIDHERE should be the youtube video id, a 11 character string unique to every video that's the second half of all youtube links.

https://youtube.com/watch?v=SOMERANDOMCHARACTERS
https://youtu.be/SOMERANDOMCHARACTERS

Links:
https://youtube.com/embed/VIDEOIDHERE
https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VIDEOIDHERE

Example:
https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ
In this case, the video id would be dQw4w9WgXcQ.
