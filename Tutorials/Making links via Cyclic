2. Once you've done this, keep it safe for now.
3. Go to https://app.cyclic.sh/
4. Login with Github. Sign up with GitHub if you don't have an account.
5. Go to the link you created in Step 1.
6. Follow the instructions on the webpage. If it has the error "Unauthorised," make sure that you logged in with Github on step 4.
7. Press "Connect". You will need to confirm it with GitHub.
8. Continue following the directions. It's pretty straightforward.
9. Once you finish, the deployed link will be at the bottom!
