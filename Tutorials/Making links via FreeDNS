Making links via FreeDNS:
1. Go to https://freedns.afraid.org/. If it's blocked, try this on another device (you can't put the site through an unblocker, it won't work.)
2. This is probably your first time, so click "Sign Up for Free." If you already have an account, go to step 5.
3. Fill out all of the information in the boxes.
-> For your first and last name, you don't have to put your real name.
-> For the user ID, you can put anything, make sure it's unique.
-> For your email, you could use a temporary email provider like TempMail so you can create more links in the future.
4. Press sign-up after filling the boxes, and complete the email activation.
5. After making an account, now we are going to register the link. Go to this page in freeDNS: https://freedns.afraid.org/domain/registry
-> Alternatively, press "Subdomains" on the left side of the page;
   then "Add subdomain";
   then on the "Domain" box click on the dropdown;
   then click "many, many more.";
   After that click "Shared Domain Registry" on the first sentence.
6. Click a domain link that you would like to use. (e.g. chickenkiller.com)
-> Make sure to select a domain that is unblocked for you. Domains that have a low popularity are probably unblocked.
-> Also make sure that the domain is public.
7. In the configurations page, on the top make sure "A" record type is selected (it should be already).
8. Enter the name of the subdomain - it can be anything. (subdomainName.chosenDomain.com)
9. For the destination, it depends on what unblocker you want to use.
10. After putting the IP destination to your subdomain, press "save". Complete the captcha.
11. Wait a couple minutes for your site to register and go to the link you created!
